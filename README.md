## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am-5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## My Goal

This week, we were given starter code from the student repository. 
My first mission for this assignment will be to replicate the example functionality of the application by creating multiple jQuery scripts.
Second, I will need to allow the user to save their input into local storage so they may view their saved work whenever they come back to visit the page.
Finally, I will utilize dayjs to display the time on top of the page, as well as to determine if a tasks' time slot is past, current, or yet to come.
